The solution cotains of 3 Classes: 1) Cell - which is the representation of a cell; 
                                   2) Grid - which is representation of a grid containing cells;
                                   3) GameOfLife - in which we create 2 grids and iterate them in order 
                                   to simulate the behaviour desired.
